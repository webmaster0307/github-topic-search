## Dev Notes

- I have used Apollo Client as through manage the state of the application
- Ant Design to use predefine component for UI
- React-testing-library to create test cases for the application.

### How to run app & test

- Run `npm install` to get all required dependencies installed.
- Then run `npm start` to run project on localhost, i.e. *localhost:3000*
- To run test cases, run `npm run test`, it will execute the unit tests on the terminal screen.
  - It will show the results of the test when the test process get finished.

### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics

- Code Structuring:

  - Adding Error handing code in order to different error which can encounter the system
  - Improving code Structure .

- Refactoring:

  - Make component for error text
  - Component for loader .

- Additional Features:
  - Using typescripts in order to Tightly couple everything with graph ql.
  - Adding unit testing for test case
